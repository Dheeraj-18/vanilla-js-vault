// <------------------------ Summary Notes  ------------------>

// NOTE.1: In Javascript (==) isequal  comparison use by default implicit type conversion and it's weird behavior of 
//         javascript on the other side (===)  strict equal also check there type are also equal or not and for different
//         value comparison , we must do Explicit type conversion using + or ParseInt()
