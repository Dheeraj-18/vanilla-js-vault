//     <-------------------------       Summary or KEY Note         --------------------> 

// 1.   for any real no. we have one data type in js i.e number 
// 2.   for string we must use '' or "" and `` backtick (it give a ability to add new line and also other feature
//      we will see further in the course 
// 3.   Easy and intuitive To convert a string data type to number by put a +(unary addition) before string 
//      eg. +'100' or +'-100' it give output 100 and -100 in number
//      eg. +'100adhfahdk' show NaN
// 3.a) typeof
// 4.   NaN (not a number)
// 5.   ParseInt() convert string into number
// 6.   Covert a number to string by 100 + '' or '' + 100 
// 7.   boolean have two value true or false it we write +true of +false in console it 1 and 0 in output 
// 8.   undefined is a type and it's have only one value i.e undefined typeof undefined give a output on console is 
//      undefined 
// 9.   null is similar to undefined by the difference is javascript by default set to undefined which it not found, 
//      but not in case with null we explicitly declare null to variable and we also declare  undefined explicitly if we want 
//      eg. +null give console output is 0.
//      eg. +undefined give console output is NaN . 
//      eg. ParseInt(undefined) give console output is NaN 
//      > typeof NaN   give output -> number 
// 10.  _IMP. typeof null give console output is object This is a BUG IN javascript desired output is null but IN 
//      a initial phase bug in JS till now it't not fixed 
// 11. String is immutable in nature that means if we declare let message ="Hello world" so we cannot change the perticular character on index but 
//     but we reassign it the whole string  .
