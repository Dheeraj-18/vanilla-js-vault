//                               ===================================

// ðŸ‘‰ Every method is a function, but not every function is a method.

//         If it's inside an object â†’ it's a method.

//         If it's outside on its own â†’ it's just a function.

// we also think like we use some method use with string like touppercase() but string is not object yes it might confusing now but  we will that in 
// upcoming lecture actually is there a string wrapper in present
