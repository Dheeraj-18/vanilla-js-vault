// Note: Debouncing is a programming technique that helps to improve the performance of web applications by
//       limiting the frequency of function calls. (think of this as
//       something like a rate limiter

// Note: In general, Debouncing is a way of delaying the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the
//       last time it was called. This can be useful for scenarios where
//       we want to avoid unnecessary or repeated function calls that
//       might be expensive or time-consuming
